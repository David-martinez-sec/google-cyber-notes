# More About OWASP Security Principles

---

## Overview
Security principles are best practices applied daily in cybersecurity tasks, such as log analysis, SIEM monitoring, and vulnerability scanning.  
OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project®) outlines key principles that help analysts safeguard data and reduce risks.

## Core OWASP Security Principles (Previously Covered)
- **Minimize attack surface area** – Reduce all possible vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.  
- **Principle of least privilege** – Grant the minimal access necessary to perform tasks.  
- **Defense in depth** – Use multiple, layered security controls to mitigate risks.  
- **Separation of duties** – Require multiple people for critical actions, each with limited privileges.  
- **Keep security simple** – Avoid unnecessary complexity that hinders security.  
- **Fix security issues correctly** – Identify root cause, contain impact, patch vulnerabilities, and test fixes.

## Additional OWASP Security Principles

### **Establish Secure Defaults**
- Default settings should be the most secure option.
- Making a system insecure should require explicit, intentional changes.

### **Fail Securely**
- If a security control fails, it should default to its most secure state.
- Example: A firewall failure should block all traffic, not allow everything.

### **Don’t Trust Services**
- Third-party systems may not follow your security standards.
- Always verify partner data before use.

### **Avoid Security by Obscurity**
- Security should not rely solely on secrecy of system details.
- Use strong password policies, layered defenses, and robust architecture.
