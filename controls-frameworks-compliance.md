# Module 3 ‚Äì Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance  
*Google Cybersecurity Certificate*

## üß† What I Did

- Completed the first section of Module 3 on security controls, frameworks, and compliance regulations.
- Reflected on the relationship between public frameworks and how they might inform threat actors.

---

## üîë Key Concepts

### üîê Controls
- **Security controls** are safeguards used to reduce risk by mitigating vulnerabilities and threats.
- Controls are implemented alongside frameworks and are often required for compliance with laws or standards.

---

### üìê Frameworks
Security frameworks are **structured guides** used by professionals to:
1. Identify and document security goals
2. Set guidelines to achieve those goals
3. Implement strong security processes
4. Monitor and communicate results

Frameworks help professionals **design, build, and manage** secure environments.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Compliance
- **Compliance** means adhering to internal security policies and **external regulations** (such as government laws or industry standards).
- Many frameworks are developed **by organizations or governments** and adopted across industries to ensure a consistent security posture and risk management.

## üß© Common Frameworks and Standards

| Framework / Regulation | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **NIST CSF / RMF** | U.S. government frameworks for cybersecurity and risk management |
| **FERC-NERC** | Regulates power grid organizations in North America; includes Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) |
| **FedRAMP** | Standardized approach for securing U.S. federal government cloud services |
| **CIS Controls** | Actionable guidelines developed by the Center for Internet Security for securing systems and responding to threats |
| **GDPR** | EU regulation protecting citizens' data and privacy; includes breach notification within 72 hours |
| **PCI DSS** | Global standard for securing credit card data to reduce fraud |
| **HIPAA** | U.S. law protecting patient health information; includes Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification rules |
| **HITRUST** | Framework aligned with HIPAA to help organizations meet health data compliance |
| **ISO Standards** | International standards for improving organizational processes and security |
| **SOC 1 / SOC 2** | Developed by AICPA; focuses on access, data integrity, availability, and organizational risk levels |

## üîç Personal Insight

One thought I had during this section is:  
> If security frameworks are publicly available and widely implemented, wouldn't that give threat actors a blueprint of how systems are defended?

It's a valid concern ‚Äî but frameworks aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù for attackers. They define **best practices**, but each organization implements them differently. The real strength of a security posture comes from **how thoroughly**, **consistently**, and **contextually** the framework is applied ‚Äî and whether **threat detection and response** layers are functioning well in practice.

So while attackers can study frameworks, defenders still have the upper hand with monitoring, response, and customization.

## ‚úÖ Takeaways

- Controls, frameworks, and compliance work together to help reduce organizational risk.
- Security analysts must **stay current** with evolving frameworks and regulations.
- Familiarity with standards like **NIST, CIS, GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA**, and **SOC 2** is essential in any security role.
- Public frameworks don't make systems more vulnerable ‚Äî poor implementation does.
