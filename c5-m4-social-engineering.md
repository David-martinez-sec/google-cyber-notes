# Social Engineering Tactics

## Overview

Social engineering attacks are a popular choice among threat actors
because it's often easier to trick people into providing access,
information, or money than to exploit software or network
vulnerabilities.

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error
to gain private information, access, or valuables. It is an umbrella
term for a range of attacks designed to capitalize on the trusting
nature of people and their willingness to help.

## Social Engineering Risks

-   **Impersonation:** Hackers pretend to be someone the target knows.
-   **Exploitation of human nature:** Curiosity, generosity, and
    excitement can be used against people, leading them to poor
    decisions.
-   **Case Study -- Twitter Hack (2020):** Hackers impersonated IT staff
    over the phone, tricking employees into giving access to internal
    tools. They took over accounts of politicians, celebrities, and
    entrepreneurs.

These attacks are dangerous because they don't require advanced
technical skills. Defense requires both technological controls and user
awareness.

## Signs of an Attack

Social engineering often bypasses technological defenses. Recognizing
warning signs helps reduce risks.

### Common Techniques

-   **Baiting:** Luring people with something tempting (e.g., infected
    USB drives).
-   **Phishing:** Using emails or digital communication to steal
    sensitive data or deliver malware.
-   **Quid pro quo:** Offering false rewards in exchange for information
    (e.g., impersonating a bank loan officer).
-   **Tailgating (Piggybacking):** Following authorized personnel into
    restricted areas.
-   **Watering Hole Attacks:** Infecting trusted websites frequently
    visited by a target group (e.g., Holy Water attack, 2020).

## Encouraging Caution

Security awareness training is critical. Focus areas include: - **Stay
alert:** Watch for suspicious communications, spelling errors, and
mismatched email addresses. - **Limit sharing:** Be cautious about
posting personal information on social media. - **Control curiosity:**
Avoid clicking on suspicious attachments, links, or "too good to be
true" offers.

**Pro Tip:** Firewalls, MFA, blocklists, and email filtering add extra
protection if a mistake is made.

Security training should extend to customers as well. Analysts play a
key role by testing systems, documenting best practices, and promoting
awareness.

## Key Takeaways

-   Social engineering exploits trust and human error.
-   Attacks rely on deception, impersonation, and manipulation.
-   Awareness, training, and layered defenses are essential to reducing
    risks.
