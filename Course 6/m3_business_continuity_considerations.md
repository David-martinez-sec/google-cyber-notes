## Business Continuity Planning (BCP)  
- **Purpose:** Ensure critical operations continue during/after disruptions.  
- A **BCP** = documented procedures to sustain business functions after incidents.  
- Benefits: Minimizes **legal, financial, and reputational damage** from prolonged outages.  
- Distinction:  
  - **BCP** → Keeps business operations running.  
  - **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** → Focuses on restoring IT systems after disasters (hardware failure, natural disasters).

## Example: Ransomware and Business Continuity  
- Ransomware can severely disrupt operations:  
  - Encrypts data → prevents access to records (e.g., medical records in healthcare).  
  - Impacts essential services, critical infrastructure, and national/economic security.  
- **BCPs** minimize downtime, allowing essential services to remain accessible.

## Recovery Strategies in BCPs  

### Site Resilience  
- **Resilience** = prepare, respond, recover from disruptions.  
- Recovery sites ensure service continuity:  

1. **Hot Site**  
   - Fully operational duplicate of primary site.  
   - Activated immediately during disruptions.  

2. **Warm Site**  
   - Configured backup facility, updated with data/software.  
   - Requires minimal setup before becoming operational.  

3. **Cold Site**  
   - Basic backup facility with partial infrastructure.  
   - Requires significant setup before operations can resume.

## Key Takeaways  
- Security incidents can cause **serious operational disruptions**.  
- **BCPs** provide structured response/recovery to minimize impact.  
- Recovery site strategies (hot, warm, cold) support resilience.  
- Business continuity ensures essential services continue despite security incidents.
