|  **Risk analysis** | USB drives can carry malicious code such as spyware, ransomware, or programs that create backdoors into a network. If an employee were to plug in an unknown device, the computerâ€™s autorun feature could launch malware without warning, allowing attackers to alter, steal, or delete company files. To reduce this risk, autorun should be disabled on all USB-enabled devices, and clear policies should prohibit the use of unknown drives. When company-issued USB devices are used, they should be protected with encryption and strong passwords to safeguard sensitive data. |
