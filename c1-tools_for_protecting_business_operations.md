## üõ†Ô∏è Entry-Level Analyst‚Äôs Toolkit

### 1. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools
- **Purpose:** Collect and analyze log data to monitor critical activities.
- **Benefits:**  
  - Provides alerts for specific threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.  
  - Uses dashboards to visualize and categorize data.  
  - Reduces analyst workload by filtering relevant information.  
- **Hosting Options:**  
  - **On-premise** ‚Äì Requires more setup and maintenance.  
  - **Cloud-hosted** ‚Äì Easier to set up and maintain, often chosen by less experienced teams.

### 2. Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)
- **Purpose:** Capture and analyze network data traffic.  
- **Function:** Keeps records of all data a computer in the network encounters.  
- **Use Case:** Helps identify malicious activity or troubleshoot network performance issues.

---

### 3. Playbooks
- **Definition:** Manuals that outline processes and procedures for specific security actions.
- **Purpose:** Ensure consistent and proper execution of security-related tasks.
- **Example Scenario:**  
  - Forensic investigation after a breach at a medical practice.
  - Findings provided to a cybersecurity insurance company to determine payout eligibility.

## üìë Two Key Forensic Playbooks

### **A. Chain of Custody Playbook**
- **Purpose:** Document evidence possession and control throughout an incident lifecycle.
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Track who has the evidence, when, where, and why.  
  - Keep evidence secure at all times.  
  - Report every time evidence changes location or custodian.  
- **Goal:** Maintain evidence integrity and credibility in an investigation.

### **B. Protecting and Preserving Evidence Playbook**
- **Purpose:** Handle fragile and volatile digital evidence properly.  
- **Order of Volatility:** Preserve the most volatile data first (data that disappears if the device powers off).  
- **Best Practice:** Work from copies of evidence to avoid compromising the original.
