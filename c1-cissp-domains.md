# 🛡️ CISSP Domains: Study Notes  
*Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)*

---

## 📋 Overview

The CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certification is built around **8 security domains**. These domains define the core areas of cybersecurity knowledge and guide the responsibilities of security professionals, especially those in roles like SOC analysts, security engineers, and CISOs.

---

## 🔒 1. Security and Risk Management

**Focus:** Policies, governance, compliance, and risk.

- Information security principles (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
- Security governance and compliance (laws, regulations, policies)
- Risk analysis and mitigation
- Ethics and professional standards
- Security awareness and training
- Business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR)

✅ *Think of this as the foundation for managing all other domains.*

---

## 🏢 2. Asset Security

**Focus:** Protecting information and hardware.

- Data classification and ownership (public, confidential, etc.)
- Asset handling and retention policies
- Privacy protection (PII, PHI)
- Secure data lifecycle and destruction

✅ *Where is your data? Who owns it? How is it protected?*

---

## 🌐 3. Security Architecture and Engineering

**Focus:** Designing and implementing secure systems.

- Secure system design (hardware, software, cloud, IoT)
- Security models and frameworks (Bell-LaPadula, Biba, etc.)
- Cryptography fundamentals
- Vulnerability and fault tolerance
- Physical security

✅ *This domain is like the blueprint for building secure tech environments.*

---

## 📡 4. Communication and Network Security

**Focus:** Securing network infrastructure and data in transit.

- Network architecture and design
- Secure protocols (SSL/TLS, HTTPS, VPN, etc.)
- Firewalls, IDS/IPS, proxies
- Network attacks and defenses (DDoS, man-in-the-middle)
- Secure communication channels

✅ *Protecting data as it moves between systems and networks.*

---

## 🧑‍💻 5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Focus:** Controlling who can access what.

- Authentication and authorization (MFA, biometrics, RBAC)
- Access control models (DAC, MAC, ABAC)
- Identity provisioning and lifecycle
- Single sign-on (SSO), federation

✅ *Right person, right access, right time — nothing more, nothing less.*

---

## 🛠️ 6. Security Assessment and Testing

**Focus:** Validating the effectiveness of security controls.

- Security audits and assessments
- Vulnerability scans and penetration testing
- Log reviews and monitoring
- Reporting and metrics
- Internal and third-party testing

✅ *Are your security measures actually working?*

---

## 🔄 7. Security Operations

**Focus:** Daily tasks, incident response, and disaster recovery.

- SOC operations and incident response plans
- Forensics and evidence handling
- Monitoring, SIEM, alerts
- Patch and change management
- Recovery strategies and continuity plans

✅ *This is where theory meets day-to-day security reality.*

---

## 🔧 8. Software Development Security

**Focus:** Secure coding and application security.

- Secure SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
- Common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10)
- Code reviews, testing, and change control
- DevSecOps and automation
- Application security controls

✅ *Security starts at the code level — build it in, don’t bolt it on.*
