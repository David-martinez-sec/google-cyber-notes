# Module 2 ‚Äì Common Attacks and Their Effectiveness

## üß† Overview

This section explores common methods of attack used by threat actors. You‚Äôll learn about phishing, malware, and social engineering‚Äîhow they work, why they‚Äôre effective, and how they‚Äôve shaped the cybersecurity landscape.

Early attacks like the ILOVEYOU virus and the Morris worm highlighted the need for incident response teams. Today, CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident Response Teams) are essential for defending organizations. Understanding how modern attacks work will help you anticipate and defend against threats.

## üéØ Phishing

Phishing involves using digital communication to deceive people into revealing sensitive information or triggering malicious activity.

**Types of phishing attacks:**
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** Spoofed emails from seemingly trusted sources to steal data or money.
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeted emails aimed at specific individuals or groups.
- **Whaling:** Spear phishing aimed at executives to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Vishing:** Voice calls used to impersonate someone and steal information.
- **Smishing:** SMS messages used to deceive and gather sensitive data.

## ü¶† Malware

Malware is software intentionally designed to damage, exploit, or disable systems.

**Common types of malware:**
- **Virus:** Malicious code that requires user action to activate, then spreads and damages systems.
- **Worm:** Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without needing user interaction.
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts a victim‚Äôs data and demands payment to restore access.
- **Spyware:** Secretly gathers personal or organizational data without permission.

## üß† Social Engineering

Social engineering manipulates human behavior to gain unauthorized access to information or systems.

**Common social engineering attacks:**
- **Social Media Phishing:** Uses public data from platforms to personalize attacks.
- **Watering Hole Attacks:** Infects websites that specific users or organizations frequently visit.
- **USB Baiting:** Infected USB devices left in public to lure users into connecting them.
- **Physical Social Engineering:** Threat actors pose as employees or vendors to enter restricted spaces.

## üìö Social Engineering Principles

Social engineering works so well because it preys on human psychology and trust. Threat actors exploit emotions, habits, and authority to gain access.

**Key psychological tactics:**
- **Authority:** Impersonating figures of power to gain compliance.
- **Intimidation:** Using pressure or threats to force action.
- **Consensus (Social Proof):** Citing others' actions to legitimize a request.
- **Scarcity:** Creating a sense of urgency by limiting availability.
- **Familiarity:** Building fake relationships that feel trustworthy.
- **Trust:** Establishing rapport over time to gain sensitive info.
- **Urgency:** Forcing quick decisions without time to think critically.

## üìå Key Takeaways

- Cyberattacks continue to evolve, but many still rely on human vulnerability.
- Social engineering is highly effective because it targets people, not systems.
- Understanding attacker tactics helps you become a stronger defender.
- Phishing, malware, and social engineering are three core categories every analyst must understand.
