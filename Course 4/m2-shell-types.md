## Communicate Through a Shell
The **shell** is the command-line interpreter — a translator between you and the computer system.  

- You enter a command → the shell interprets it → sends it to the **kernel** → returns results.  
- This allows users to communicate with the operating system in a text-based way.

- **Bourne-Again Shell (bash)**  
- **C Shell (csh)**  
- **Korn Shell (ksh)**

All shells use common Linux commands, but they differ in features:

- **zsh** may use `%` as the prompt symbol.

## Bash
- **Bash** is the default shell in most Linux distributions.  
- Considered **user-friendly** and versatile.  
- Supports both **basic commands** and **larger scripting projects**.  
- Bash is the **most popular shell in the cybersecurity profession**.  
- You’ll use bash throughout this course to practice Linux commands.
