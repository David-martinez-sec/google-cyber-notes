# The Data Lifecycle

## Overview
Data can be vulnerable whether it is at rest, in use, or in transit. Regardless of its state, it must be kept private by limiting access and authorization. The **data lifecycle** is a model used by security teams to map data vulnerabilities and apply security controls that maintain the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad**.

## The Data Lifecycle Stages
The five stages of the data lifecycle describe how information flows through an organization:

1. **Collect** – Data is gathered from internal and external sources.  
2. **Store** – Data is placed in databases, file systems, or other storage solutions.  
3. **Use** – Data is accessed and processed to support business functions.  
4. **Archive** – Data that is no longer actively used is stored for compliance or historical purposes.  
5. **Destroy** – Data is securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable when it is no longer useful.  

Protecting data at each stage ensures accessibility and recoverability if something goes wrong.

## Data Governance
Data governance is a structured set of processes that define how an organization manages information across its lifecycle. It includes policies that keep data private, accurate, available, and secure.

### Governance Roles
- **Data owner**: Decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy information.  
- **Data custodian**: Responsible for safe handling, transport, and storage of data.  
- **Data steward**: Maintains and enforces governance policies within the organization.  

*Note:* As a **data custodian**, you will primarily maintain security and privacy rules.

## Protecting Data at Every Stage
Organizations often have a **data governance policy**, which:  
- Defines procedures for handling data.  
- Places limits on who or what can access data.  
- Ensures security professionals protect information from damage, theft, or misuse.

## Legally Protected Information
Data can represent personal thoughts, choices, financial activity, or medical decisions. Because of its sensitivity, governments enforce protections:

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information):** Any data used to infer or identify an individual (e.g., name, phone number, address).  
- **PHI (Protected Health Information):** Regulated in the U.S. under HIPAA and in the EU under GDPR. Covers health-related data.  
- **SPII (Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information):** A subset of PII with stricter handling requirements, such as bank account numbers or login credentials.  

Security professionals must respect data owners’ privacy decisions and follow regulations to protect sensitive information.

## Key Takeaways
- The **data lifecycle** has five stages: collect, store, use, archive, and destroy.  
- **Data governance policies** define how data is handled, secured, and accessed.  
- Roles include **data owners, custodians, and stewards**, each with unique responsibilities.  
- **PII, PHI, and SPII** require strong protections against unauthorized access and disclosure.  
- As a data custodian, you play a key role in keeping data secure and private throughout its lifecycle.
