# Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Cyber attacks can sometimes be prevented with the right information,
which starts with knowing where your systems are vulnerable. Previously,
you learned that the CVE® list and scanning tools are two useful ways of
finding weaknesses. But, there are other ways to identify
vulnerabilities and threats.

In this reading, you'll learn about open-source intelligence, commonly
known as OSINT. OSINT is the collection and analysis of information from
publicly available sources to generate usable intelligence. It's
commonly used to support cybersecurity activities, like identifying
potential threats and vulnerabilities. You'll learn why open-source
intelligence is gathered and how it can improve cybersecurity. You'll
also learn about commonly used resources and tools for gathering
information and intelligence.

## Information vs Intelligence

The terms **intelligence** and **information** are often used
interchangeably, making it easy to mix them up. Both are important
aspects of cybersecurity that differ in their focus and objectives.

-   **Information** refers to the collection of raw data or facts about
    a specific subject.\
-   **Intelligence** refers to the analysis of information to produce
    knowledge or insights that can be used to support decision-making.

**Example:**\
- Information: New details are released about an OS update.\
- Intelligence: Research shows new threats linked to this update.\
- Decision: Your organization delays or modifies rollout until risks are
mitigated.

In short: **Intelligence is derived from information through analysis,
interpretation, and integration.**

## Intelligence Improves Decision-Making

Businesses often use information to gain insights into customer
behavior. Intelligence is then used to improve decision-making. In
security, **open-source information** is used to gain insights into
threats and vulnerabilities that can pose risks to an organization.

OSINT plays a significant role in **information security (InfoSec)**,
the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.

**Example:**\
An InfoSec team might monitor hacker forums for vulnerabilities. If they
find a post about a flaw in software they use, they can assess risk,
prioritize patching, and take action before an attack occurs.

### OSINT Can Be Used To:

-   Provide insights into cyber attacks\
-   Detect potential data exposures\
-   Evaluate existing defenses\
-   Identify unknown vulnerabilities

Collecting intelligence is often part of **vulnerability management**.
OSINT helps security teams profile threats and make data-driven
decisions.

## OSINT Tools

The internet provides massive amounts of open-source information. The
challenge is finding what's relevant. Sources include search engines,
social media, blogs, and discussion boards. Tools can help streamline
this process.

### Examples of OSINT Tools:

-   **VirusTotal**: Analyze suspicious files, domains, URLs, and IPs.\
-   **MITRE ATT&CK®**: Knowledge base of adversary tactics and
    techniques.\
-   **OSINT Framework**: A web-based interface of categorized OSINT
    tools.\
-   **Have I Been Pwned**: Search for compromised email accounts.

There are countless other OSINT tools. It's up to the researcher to find
the right sources for the problem at hand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Takeaways

-   Gathering **information** and **intelligence** are both critical in
    cybersecurity.\
-   OSINT enables evidence-based decisions that can help prevent
    attacks.\
-   Skilled searching and familiarity with tools make research easier.\
-   Security professionals should develop strong OSINT skills to improve
    defenses.
