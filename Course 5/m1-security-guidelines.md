# Course 5 Module 1: Security Guidelines in Action (NIST CSF)

## Overview
Organizations face a constant flood of risks. Security frameworks, like the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, provide structured guidance to help manage these risks effectively.  
The CSF is widely adopted because of its **flexibility**, allowing organizations of any size or sector to adapt it to their needs.

---

## Origins of the Framework
- Released in **2014** by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  
- Initially designed to protect U.S. critical infrastructure.  
- Adapted to support both public and private sectors, including small businesses.  
- Goal: Provide a **flexible, standardized resource** for managing cybersecurity risk.

## Components of the CSF

### 1. Core
- **Definition**: A set of desired outcomes to guide organizations.  
- **Six functions** (expanded in 2024 from five):  
  1. Identify  
  2. Protect  
  3. Detect  
  4. Respond  
  5. Recover  
  6. Govern (*added in 2024 to stress leadership and decision-making*)  

- Functions help organizations:  
  - Identify critical assets.  
  - Apply safeguards.  
  - Detect attacks.  
  - Develop response & recovery plans.  
  - Emphasize leadership in risk management.  

### 2. Tiers
- **Definition**: Measure the maturity and sophistication of an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity program.  
- **Scale**: 1 to 4  
  - Tier 1: Minimal controls.  
  - Tier 4: Advanced, risk-informed security posture.  
- Purpose: Assess posture, highlight gaps, and identify improvements.  

### 3. Profiles
- **Definition**: Pre-built templates created by industry experts.  
- **Purpose**: Tailor the CSF to specific industries or organizational risks.  
- Uses:  
  - Baseline for cybersecurity planning.  
  - Benchmarking against industry standards.  

> Note: While there are three main components, the CSF also contains many **subcategories and processes**.

## Implementing the CSF
Compliance plays a major role in adoption:  
- **Compliance** = adhering to internal standards & external regulations.  
- **Frameworks** = optional resources; **regulations** = mandatory rules.  

The CSF is **voluntary**, but widely used to help achieve compliance.  

### Common Steps (per CISA guidance)
1. Create a **current profile** of security operations.  
2. Perform a **risk assessment** against business and regulatory standards.  
3. **Analyze and prioritize gaps** that place assets at risk.  
4. **Implement a plan of action** to address goals and objectives.  

> **Pro tip**: Always account for evolving **risk, threat, and vulnerability trends** when applying the CSF.

## Industries Embracing the CSF
- Influenced by standards and best practices from leading global companies.  
- Widely used across industries worldwide.  
- Helps align security practices and regulatory compliance with business partners.  

---

## Key Takeaways
- The NIST CSF is **flexible, voluntary, and globally relevant**.  
- Core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, Govern) guide security planning.  
- Tiers measure maturity; Profiles provide industry-specific tailoring.  
- Implementation challenges exist but are offset by benefits like compliance alignment and stronger posture.  

---

## Personal Takeaways
- The CSF provides a **roadmap** rather than a rigid rulebook.  
- The new **Govern function** reinforces the importance of leadership in cybersecurity.  
- Profiles and tiers make the CSF accessible to both large enterprises and small businesses.  
- As a professional, fluency with CSF makes it easier to work across industries and demonstrate compliance.
