# Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Date:** 15th September 2025

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of
memory. It runs on the latest version of the Linux operating system and
hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable
network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers
on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access
controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three
months, from June 2024 to August 2024. NIST SP 800-30 Rev.Â 1 is used to
guide the risk analysis of the information system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose

The database server is a centralized system that stores and manages
customer, campaign, and analytic data. This information is used to
identify potential customers, track marketing performance, and
personalize outreach efforts. Because this server directly supports the
company's ability to attract and retain customers, it is a vital
business asset.

Securing the data on this server is critical to:\
- Protect customer privacy and meet regulatory compliance.\
- Safeguard the brand reputation from data breach incidents.\
- Ensure reliable access to business-critical data.

If the server were disabled or compromised, the company would face
reduced customer acquisition capabilities, significant operational
disruptions, and reputational and financial harm.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Approach

Risks were evaluated based on the open accessibility of the database
server and its role in storing customer and business data. The
likelihood scores considered common attacker motivations, the prevalence
of insider mistakes, and the potential for technical failures. Severity
scores were assigned by examining the impact of potential incidents on
day-to-day business operations.

Key rationale:\
- **Hackers** represent the highest risk due to the public exposure of
the database, creating opportunities for both exfiltration and data
alteration.\
- **Employees** present a moderate risk, since misconfigurations or
errors could disrupt operations.\
- **Networking/technological risks** were included, as resource
depletion or misconfigurations could create downtime and performance
issues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Remediation Strategy

To mitigate these risks, the following measures are recommended:

1.  **Implement Strong Access Controls**
    -   Require multi-factor authentication (MFA).\
    -   Enforce role-based access controls (RBAC).\
    -   Apply least privilege principles for all accounts.
2.  **Encrypt and Secure Communications**
    -   Upgrade from SSL to **TLS** encryption for data in transit.\
    -   Enforce database traffic encryption end-to-end.
3.  **Restrict Public Exposure**
    -   Apply **IP allow-listing** so only company offices and VPN
        endpoints can connect.\
    -   Segment the database server into a private subnet behind a
        firewall.
4.  **Monitoring and Intrusion Prevention**
    -   Enable continuous monitoring and logging of all access
        attempts.\
    -   Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to detect and block
        malicious activity.
5.  **Operational Best Practices**
    -   Regular patching and updates of database and OS.\
    -   Routine audits of access logs and configurations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

Leaving the database server open to the public introduces a severe and
business-critical risk. Hackers could exfiltrate or alter sensitive
data, employees may accidentally disrupt operations, and technical
failures could lead to downtime.

By implementing strict access controls, encrypting communications with
TLS, limiting public exposure through IP allow-listing, and adopting
continuous monitoring and intrusion prevention, the company can
significantly reduce its attack surface.

**Securing this server should be prioritized immediately** to protect
customer trust, ensure compliance, and support uninterrupted business
operations.
