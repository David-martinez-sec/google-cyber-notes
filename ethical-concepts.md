### üî• Counterattacks and Legal Constraints

#### United States
- **Counterattacks are illegal** under laws such as:
  - Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)
  - Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (2015)
- U.S. law only permits **defensive actions**; offensive actions are considered *vigilantism*.
- Risks:
  - Escalation of attacks
  - Potential international incidents if the threat actor is state-sponsored
- Only **authorized federal employees or military personnel** may conduct counterattacks.

#### International
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) allows counterattacks only if:
  1. They affect only the original attacker.
  2. They are direct communications asking the attacker to stop.
  3. They avoid escalation.
  4. Their effects are reversible.
- In practice:
  - Organizations rarely counterattack due to difficulty in meeting these conditions.
  - Actions can lead to worse outcomes if handled improperly.
- *Reference:* Tallinn Manual for guidance on cyber operations in international law.

### üß© Ethical Principles & Methodologies

#### Confidentiality
- Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
- Respect for privacy is central to safeguarding data.

#### Privacy Protection
- Protects **PII** (Personally Identifiable Information) and **SPII** (Sensitive PII):
  - **PII:** Name, phone number.
  - **SPII:** Social Security number, credit card number.
- Obligations:
  - Secure private information
  - Identify vulnerabilities
  - Manage risks
  - Align security with business goals

#### Laws
- Legally recognized rules enforced by governing bodies.
- Ethical obligations:
  - Remain unbiased and honest
  - Follow laws and regulations
  - Be transparent and evidence-based
  - Stay engaged, informed, and committed to improving the cyber landscape
- Example: **HIPAA**
  - U.S. law protecting Protected Health Information (PHI)
  - Requires patient consent before sharing data
  - Mandates breach notification if PHI is exposed
