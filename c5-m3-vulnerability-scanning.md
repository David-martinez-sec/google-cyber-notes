# Approaches to Vulnerability Scanning

Previously, you learned about a vulnerability assessment, which is the
internal review process of an organization's security systems. An
organization performs vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses
and prevent attacks. Vulnerability scanning tools are commonly used to
simulate threats by finding vulnerabilities in an attack surface. They
also help security teams take proactive steps towards implementing their
remediation strategy.

Vulnerability scanners are important tools that you'll likely use in the
field. In this reading, you'll explore how vulnerability scanners work
and the types of scans they can perform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is a Vulnerability Scanner?

A vulnerability scanner is software that automatically compares known
vulnerabilities and exposures against the technologies on the network.
In general, these tools scan systems to find misconfigurations or
programming flaws.

Scanning tools are used to analyze each of the five attack surfaces that
you learned about in the defense in depth strategy:

-   **Perimeter layer:** authentication systems that validate user
    access\
-   **Network layer:** technologies like firewalls and routers\
-   **Endpoint layer:** devices on a network (laptops, desktops,
    servers)\
-   **Application layer:** software that users interact with\
-   **Data layer:** stored, in transit, or in use information

When a scan begins, the tool compares the findings against databases of
security threats. At the end of the scan, vulnerabilities are flagged
and added to its reference database. Each scan improves the accuracy of
future analyses.

> **Note:** Vulnerability databases are routinely updated by the company
> that designed the scanning software.

## Performing Scans

Vulnerability scanners are meant to be **non-intrusive**. They don't
exploit systems like an attacker would, but instead identify weak points
and alert security teams.

> **Note:** Even though they are non-intrusive, scans can sometimes
> inadvertently cause system issues, such as crashes.

Different scan types correspond to the pathways a threat actor might
take.

### External vs. Internal Scans

-   **External scans:** Test perimeter defenses like websites,
    firewalls, and outward-facing ports.\
-   **Internal scans:** Examine internal systems such as application
    software and user access controls.

### Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Scans

-   **Authenticated scans:** Use real or admin accounts to test
    vulnerabilities like broken access controls.\
-   **Unauthenticated scans:** Simulate external attackers without
    credentials. For example, testing if internal file shares can be
    accessed without proper permissions.

### Limited vs. Comprehensive Scans

-   **Limited scans:** Focus on specific devices (e.g., a firewall
    misconfiguration).\
-   **Comprehensive scans:** Review all connected devices, operating
    systems, and user databases.

> **Pro tip:** Run a **discovery scan** first. Discovery scanning maps
> the devices, systems, and open ports before running detailed scans.

## Key Takeaways

-   Vulnerability scans vary depending on the surface and goal.\
-   Security professionals configure and lead scans, but analysts play a
    critical role in reviewing results.\
-   Scan results often drive compliance efforts, system patching, and
    procedural changes.\
-   Understanding the objectives of vulnerability scan types helps you
    contribute effectively to security assessments.
