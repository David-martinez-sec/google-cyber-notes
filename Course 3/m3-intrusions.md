# How Intrusions Compromise Your System

Every network has inherent vulnerabilities and could become the target of a network attack.  

Attackers may have **financial, personal, or political motivations**, or may be disgruntled employees or activists who disagree with a company‚Äôs values. Because malicious actors can target any network, security analysts must stay alert to potential vulnerabilities and act quickly to mitigate them.

This section covers **network interception attacks** and **backdoor attacks**, along with their possible impacts.

## Network Interception Attacks

Network interception attacks work by intercepting network traffic to **steal valuable information** or **interfere with transmission**.  

- **Packet sniffing**: Attackers use hardware/software to capture and inspect data in transit.  
- **Message alteration**: Attackers may change the contents of intercepted traffic (e.g., redirecting a bank transfer).  
- **Malicious code injection**: Modifying traffic to insert harmful code.  

Types of interception attacks include:  
- On-path attacks  
- Replay attacks

## Backdoor Attacks

Backdoors are **weaknesses intentionally left** by programmers or administrators that bypass normal access controls.  

- Legitimate purpose: Simplify troubleshooting or administrative tasks.  
- Exploited purpose: Attackers install backdoors after compromising a system to ensure **persistent access**.  

Once inside through a backdoor, attackers can:  
- Install malware  
- Launch denial of service (DoS) attacks  
- Steal private information  
- Modify security settings to leave systems open to future exploits  

‚ö†Ô∏è A **DoS attack** floods a network or server with traffic, making it unavailable for normal use.

## Possible Impacts on an Organization

### 1. Financial  
- Loss of revenue from downtime (DoS, ransomware, etc.)  
- Costly infrastructure repairs and reparation  
- Litigation and settlement costs if customer data is leaked  

### 2. Reputation  
- Loss of public trust  
- Customers may switch to competitors  

### 3. Public Safety  
- Attacks on government or infrastructure can cause **real-world harm**  
- Examples: power grids, water systems, defense communication systems

## Key Takeaways

- **Network interception** and **backdoor attacks** are common intrusion methods.  
- These intrusions can have **financial, reputational, and safety impacts**.  
- Security analysts must:  
  - Stay educated on vulnerabilities  
  - Proactively secure systems  
  - Reduce both the likelihood and impact of attacks  

üîë *Securing networks has never been more important.*
