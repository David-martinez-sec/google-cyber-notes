# Module 2 ‚Äì Determine the Type of Attack

## üß† Overview

In this reading, you explored how cybersecurity attacks are categorized across the **eight CISSP security domains**. Understanding how attacks map to these domains helps analysts organize their responsibilities, manage risk, and recognize the wide spectrum of threats targeting digital and physical systems.

## üîì Attack Types

### üîë Password Attacks

Password attacks are attempts to access systems or data protected by passwords.

**Common techniques:**
- **Brute Force:** Tries all possible password combinations until one works.
- **Rainbow Table:** Uses precomputed hash values to reverse-engineer password hashes quickly by matching known hashes to guessed inputs.

**CISSP Domain:** Communication and Network Security

### üé≠ Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering exploits human trust to gain access, data, or credentials. These attacks manipulate people rather than directly exploiting software or systems.

**Common forms:**
- **Phishing:** Fake emails designed to trick users into clicking links or giving up credentials.
- **Smishing:** Similar to phishing, but through text messages.
- **Vishing:** Voice-based phishing over phone calls.
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing aimed at a specific person or group.
- **Whaling:** Spear phishing that targets executives or high-level personnel.
- **Social Media Phishing:** Collecting data from platforms to craft believable attacks.
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** Impersonation of trusted entities in email to steal information or money.
- **Watering Hole Attack:** Infecting websites frequently visited by targets.
- **USB Baiting:** Dropping infected USB devices in public to lure someone into using them.
- **Physical Social Engineering:** Pretending to be an employee or vendor to gain physical access.

**CISSP Domain:** Security and Risk Management

### üè¢ Physical Attacks

These are real-world attacks that impact digital security through physical means.

**Examples:**
- **Malicious USB Cable:** Looks like a charging cable but installs malware when connected.
- **Malicious Flash Drive:** Contains malware that activates upon insertion.
- **Card Cloning / Skimming:** Duplicating card data using hidden readers.

**CISSP Domain:** Asset Security

### üß† Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Adversarial AI refers to the use of machine learning against systems that rely on AI. Threat actors manipulate or trick AI systems to:
- Misclassify images or data
- Evade detection
- Generate false predictions

**CISSP Domains:** 
- Communication and Network Security  
- Identity and Access Management

---

### üîÑ Supply-Chain Attacks

These attacks target third-party vendors or partners as a means to compromise a larger organization. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in:
- Software updates
- Hardware components
- Third-party access

**CISSP Domains:** 
- Security and Risk Management  
- Security Architecture and Engineering  
- Security Operations

---

### üîê Cryptographic Attacks

These attacks aim to break or weaken encryption to access protected data.

**Types:**
- **Birthday Attack:** Uses the probability of hash collisions to find two inputs with the same hash faster than brute-force methods.
- **Collision:** Two different inputs produce the same hash output‚Äîthis can be exploited to forge data or signatures.
- **Downgrade Attack:** Forces a system to use an older, less secure protocol (like SSL or TLS 1.0), making it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities.

**CISSP Domain:** Communication and Network Security

## üß≠ Key Takeaways

The **CISSP security domains** offer a structured way to understand, classify, and defend against cybersecurity threats. While the methods listed here are only a subset, they highlight the importance of:
- Knowing how attacks work
- Identifying which domain they impact
- Preparing defenses accordingly
