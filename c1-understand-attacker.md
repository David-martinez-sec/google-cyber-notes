## Key Concepts

### üîê Threat Actors
A **threat actor** is any individual or group that poses a security risk. Understanding their **intentions** and **motivations** helps defenders anticipate and mitigate threats.

### üí£ Types of Threat Actors

#### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Highly skilled, often state-sponsored
- Remain undetected while stealing data or damaging infrastructure
- Targets: Government agencies, large corporations
- Goals: Espionage, IP theft, infrastructure disruption

#### Insider Threats
- Individuals with authorized access who abuse it
- Motivations: Sabotage, revenge, corruption, espionage, or data leaks

#### Hacktivists
- Politically motivated attackers
- Use cyberattacks to promote causes, disrupt operations, or seek fame

| **Unauthorized**   | Unethical hackers (a.k.a. black hats), exploit systems for personal gain     |

Additional hacker types:
- **Script kiddies**: Unskilled attackers using pre-built tools
- **Vigilantes**: Hackers aiming to stop unethical attackers
- **Contracted hackers**: Hired for tasks that may be legal or illegal
