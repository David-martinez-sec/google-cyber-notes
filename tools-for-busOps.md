*Google Cybersecurity Certificate*

---

## üß† What I Did
- Learned more about programming, operating systems, and essential cybersecurity tools.
- Reviewed their purposes and how they help protect organizations and individuals.
- Noted the importance of being familiar with multiple tools to increase professional value.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Their Purposes

### 1. Programming
- **Definition:** Creating a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.
- **Common Languages for Security Analysts:**
  - **Python:** Used for automation to reduce manual effort and human error.
  - **SQL:** Used to create, interact with, and query databases containing millions of data points.
- **Automation:** Reduces repetitive manual work and helps prevent human mistakes.

---

### 2. Operating Systems
- **Definition:** Interface between computer hardware and the user.
- **Examples:** Linux¬Æ, macOS¬Æ, Windows¬Æ.
- **Linux:**
  - Open-source (publicly available code, contributions encouraged).
  - Uses a **command-line interface** to execute text-based instructions.
  - Not a programming language, but relies heavily on command-line commands.

---

### 3. Web Vulnerability
- **Definition:** A flaw in a web application that can be exploited by threat actors to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or deploy malware.
- **Resource:** [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) ‚Äì A list of the most critical risks to web applications.

---

### 4. Antivirus Software
- **Purpose:** Prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses.
- **Functionality:**
  - Also called anti-malware.
  - Scans device memory for patterns indicating malware presence.

---

### 5. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- **Purpose:** Monitor system activity and alert on possible intrusions.
- **Functionality:**
  - Scans and analyzes network packets (small data units sent through networks).
  - Detects threats such as theft, unauthorized access, and suspicious activity.

---

### 6. Encryption
- **Purpose:** Ensure confidentiality by making data unreadable to unauthorized users.
- **Process:**
  - Converts **plaintext** (unencrypted data) into **ciphertext** (encrypted data).
  - **Encryption** ‚â† **Encoding**:
    - Encryption secures data using cryptography.
    - Encoding allows compatibility between different data representations.

---

### 7. Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)
- **Definition:** Simulated attack to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, applications, and processes.
- **Purpose:** Evaluate weaknesses from both internal and external threat perspectives.

---

## üìå Key Takeaways
- Programming skills (especially **Python** and **SQL**) and OS familiarity (Linux, macOS, Windows) are crucial for analysts.
- Tools like **SIEM**, **IDS**, **encryption software**, and **antivirus programs** help detect and mitigate threats.
- Understanding **web vulnerabilities** and **pen testing** techniques improves overall security readiness.
- The more tools and processes you know, the more valuable you are to an organization.
