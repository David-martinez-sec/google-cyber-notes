# An Introduction to Malware

## Overview

Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. Since its
first appearance on personal computers decades ago, malware has
developed into a variety of strains. Recognizing different types of
malware and how they spread helps security professionals stay alert and
informed.

## Types of Malware

### Virus

-   Malicious code that interferes with computer operations and damages
    data or software.
-   Requires user installation to spread.
-   Commonly spread through phishing links or attachments.

### Worm

-   Can duplicate and spread itself across systems without user action
    once installed.
-   Often targets shared drives or files across networks.
-   **Example:** Blaster worm (early 2000s) infected Windows XP and
    2000, forcing reboot loops.
-   Once widespread, but less common in recent years.

### Trojan (Trojan Horse)

-   Malware disguised as legitimate files or programs.
-   Spread through downloads, tricking users into self-infection.
-   Can be used to spy, steal access, or grant control of devices.

### Adware

-   Legitimate software that displays ads, often used in
    freeware/shareware to generate revenue.
-   **Malicious adware** is a potentially unwanted application (PUA),
    bundled with insecure software, displaying ads or installing other
    unwanted programs.

### Spyware

-   Gathers and sells information without user consent.
-   Another PUA, commonly hidden in bundleware packaged with other apps.
-   Significant issue in open-source ecosystems when misuse isn't
    anticipated.

### Scareware

-   Uses fear to trick users into infecting themselves.
-   Displays fake warnings that appear legitimate, often spread via
    emails or pop-ups.

### Fileless Malware

-   Does not rely on files stored on disk.
-   Resides in memory, using legitimate installed programs to infect
    systems.
-   Harder to detect---requires memory analysis.

### Rootkits

-   Provides remote, administrative access to a system.
-   Commonly deployed via:
    -   **Dropper:** Disguised file that installs malware when opened.
    -   **Loader:** Downloads additional malware from external sources.
-   Used to open backdoors or deploy other malware.

### Botnet

-   **Botnet = "robot network."**
-   A collection of compromised devices (bots) controlled by a
    "bot-herder."
-   Spread via viruses, worms, or trojans.
-   Used to launch large-scale attacks once enough bots are infected.

### Ransomware

-   Encrypts data and demands payment for restoration.
-   Can cause severe organizational and customer impact.
-   **Example:** *WannaCry* attack encrypted computers until ransom was
    paid in cryptocurrency.

## Key Takeaways

-   Malware exists in many forms, each with unique traits and attack
    methods.
-   Infection vectors include phishing, downloads, insecure software,
    and memory exploitation.
-   Malware defense can require specialization (e.g., malware analysis),
    but all analysts should understand the basics to recognize and
    mitigate threats.
