# Types of Phishing

## Overview

Phishing is one of the most common types of social engineering, which
are manipulation techniques that exploit human error to gain private
information, access, or valuables. It uses digital communications to
trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious
software. Sometimes phishing attacks appear to come from a trusted
person or business, leading recipients to break security procedures.

## Origins of Phishing

-   **1990s:** Phishing emerged alongside the rise of the internet.
-   Early example: **AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)** users received fake
    verification or billing emails crafted to look official.
-   This was one of the first **mass phishing** campaigns: sending
    fraudulent messages to large groups of people to increase success
    rates.
-   Attackers used stolen credentials to create fraudulent AOL accounts
    for further crimes.
-   AOL responded by updating security policies and warning users about
    phishing.

## Evolution of Phishing

By the early 2000s, phishing evolved with e-commerce and online payment
systems. Fraudulent websites resembling legitimate businesses (e.g.,
eBay, PayPal) appeared, and attackers used mass campaigns to deliver
malware.

### Five Common Types of Phishing

1.  **Email phishing:** Fake emails impersonating trusted entities.\
2.  **Smishing:** Phishing via SMS or messaging apps (iMessage,
    WhatsApp, etc.).\
3.  **Vishing:** Voice call or voicemail scams.\
4.  **Spear phishing:** Targeted emails sent to specific individuals,
    such as accountants.\
5.  **Whaling:** Aimed at high-ranking executives.

## Recent Trends

-   **2010s:** Shift from mass phishing to **targeted phishing**,
    leveraging customization to create familiarity.\
-   **Angler phishing:** Attackers impersonate customer service reps on
    social media, targeting disgruntled customers to steal information.

## Key Takeaways

-   Phishing has existed since the 1990s and remains one of the most
    profitable attack methods.\
-   While there's no complete technological solution, spreading
    awareness reduces risk.\
-   Security professionals play a critical role in training others to
    recognize phishing tactics and build a culture of security.
