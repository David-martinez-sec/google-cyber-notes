## Future of SIEM Tools
### Cloud Integration
- **Cloud-hosted SIEM:**  
  - Operated and maintained by vendors.  
  - Accessed via the internet.  
  - Ideal for organizations avoiding infrastructure ownership.
- **Cloud-native SIEM:**  
  - Fully utilizes cloud computing capabilities: **availability, flexibility, scalability**.  
  - Maintained by vendors, accessed online.

### Emerging Challenges & Developments
- **IoT Expansion:** More interconnected devices increase the attack surface and available exploitable data.
- **AI & Machine Learning Integration:**  
  - Enhanced threat identification.  
  - Improved dashboard visualization.  
  - Better data storage and analysis capabilities.

### Automation & SOAR
- **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):**  
  - Automates responses to security events.  
  - Handles routine incidents without human input.  
  - Frees analysts for complex, non-automatable incidents.
- **Goal:** Greater interoperability between security platforms and systems.
