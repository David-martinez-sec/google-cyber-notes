# Manage Common Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities
*Google Cybersecurity Certificate â€“ Risk Management and Threat Landscape*

---

## ðŸ§  Overview
Security involves protecting organizations and people from **threats, risks, and vulnerabilities**. By understanding the current threat landscape, organizations can develop policies and processes to prevent and mitigate these issues.

---

## **Risk Management**
**Goal:** Protect assets â€” both digital and physical.

**Examples of assets:**
- **Digital:** Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, mailing addresses.
- **Physical:** Payment kiosks, servers, desktop computers, office spaces.

**Risk management strategies:**
- **Acceptance:** Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity.
- **Avoidance:** Creating a plan to avoid the risk entirely.
- **Transference:** Passing the risk to a third party.
- **Mitigation:** Reducing the impact of a known risk.

**Frameworks used:**
- **NIST RMF** â€“ National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework.
- **HITRUST** â€“ Health Information Trust Alliance.

---

## **Threats**
A **threat** is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

**Common types:**
- **Insider threats:** Authorized individuals misusing access to harm the organization.
- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** Long-term unauthorized access to systems.

---

## **Risks**
A **risk** is anything that can impact the **confidentiality, integrity, or availability** (CIA) of an asset.

**Factors affecting risk:**
- **External risk:** Outside actors attempting to compromise assets.
- **Internal risk:** Employees, vendors, or partners posing a security risk.
- **Legacy systems:** Outdated systems still connected to the network.
- **Multiparty risk:** Vendors/third parties with access to sensitive information.
- **Software compliance/licensing:** Outdated or noncompliant software.

**Resources:**
- **OWASP Top 10** â€“ Updated regularly with the most critical web application risks.
- **Notable new risks (2021):**  
  - Insecure design  
  - Software and data integrity failures  
  - Server-side request forgery  

---

## **Vulnerabilities**
A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

**Examples:**
- **ProxyLogon:** Microsoft Exchange pre-authenticated vulnerability.
- **ZeroLogon:** Flaw in Microsoftâ€™s Netlogon authentication protocol.
- **Log4Shell:** Remote code execution vulnerability in Java.
- **PetitPotam:** NTLM relay attack affecting Windows LAN Manager.
- **Security logging and monitoring failures:** Lack of detection for ongoing attacks.
- **Server-side request forgery (SSRF):** Server manipulated to access/update backend resources.

**Vulnerability management tasks:**
- Continuous monitoring
- Applying patches and updates promptly
- Reducing exposure time for known vulnerabilities

**Resources:**
- **NIST National Vulnerability Database**
- **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog**

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways
- Risk management includes strategies like acceptance, avoidance, transference, and mitigation.
- Common threats include insider threats and APTs.
- Risks can be internal, external, due to legacy systems, or involve third parties.
- Vulnerabilities must be actively identified, patched, and monitored to prevent exploitation.
- Staying up-to-date with resources like **OWASP, NIST, and CISA** helps mitigate evolving threats.
