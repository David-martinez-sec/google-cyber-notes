## ðŸ§  Overview
As a cybersecurity analyst, understanding the **CISSP's eight security domains** helps you organize work, identify responsibilities, and explore specialized areas in the field. These domains cover everything from risk management to secure software development.

---

## **Domain 1: Security and Risk Management**
- **Focus:** Develop and maintain an organization's security posture.
- **Key Elements:**
  - Security goals and objectives
  - Risk mitigation
  - Compliance and legal regulations
  - Business continuity plans

---

## **Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering**
- **Focus:** Designing systems, tools, and processes to protect assets.
- **Principles:**
  - Shared responsibility
  - Threat modeling
  - Least privilege
  - Defense in depth
  - Fail securely
  - Separation of duties
  - Zero trust
  - Trust but verify
- **Example:** Using SIEM tools to monitor unusual activity.

---

## **Domain 4: Communication and Network Security**
- **Focus:** Securing physical and wireless network communications.

  - On-site, remote, and cloud network security
  - Restricted network access for remote work
  - Protecting traveling employees' connections

---

## **Domain 5: Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- **Focus:** Ensuring user identities are authenticated and authorized.
- **Principle:** Least privilege â€” only grant the access required to complete a task.
- **Example:** Limiting customer service repsâ€™ access to customer data and removing it after resolution.

---

## **Domain 6: Security Assessment and Testing**
- **Focus:** Identifying and mitigating risks through testing and audits.
- **Methods:**
  - Penetration testing
  - Security control testing
  - Data collection and analysis
  - Security audits

- **Tools & Processes:**
  - Training and awareness programs
  - Incident management and playbooks
  - Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
  - SIEM tools and log management
  - Post-breach forensics and lessons learned
- **Example:** Responding to unusual after-hours data access.

---

## **Domain 8: Software Development Security**
- **Focus:** Embedding security into the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)**.
- **Practices:**
  - Secure design, coding, testing, and release
  - Application security testing
  - Quality assurance and pen testing
- **Example:** Ensuring encryption is correctly configured for a new medical device storing patient data.
