# Course 7 - Module 1 Notes

## Activity Overview
In this module, I reviewed the basics of Python programming and why it's an important tool for security analysts.  
Since I already have some Python experience, this module served more as a refresher and I didn’t need to take additional notes.  

## What I Did
- Wrote simple Python code to practice structure and syntax.  
- Reviewed how programming concepts connect to security analysis.  

## Key Concepts
- Basics of programming and why it's useful for analysts.  
- Python data types: strings, integers, floats, Booleans, and lists.  
- Variables and how they’re used to store information.  
- Conditional statements and logical checks.  
- Iterative statements with **for** and **while** loops.  

## Personal Takeaways
This was an easy refresher for me because of my prior Python experience. It helped me get back into the flow of coding and confirm that I still remember the core concepts.  
I’m looking forward to the next section where functions will be introduced, since those are especially useful for building reusable security scripts.
