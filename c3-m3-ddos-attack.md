# Real-life DDoS Attack (2016)

## Recap: DoS vs DDoS
- **DoS attack**: Overloads a target system with unwanted traffic, making it unavailable to normal users.  
- **DDoS attack**: Uses **botnets** to send massive volumes of traffic from multiple sources at once.  
- Impact: Service outages, financial losses, and **reputation damage**.

## Targeting a DNS Server
- **DNS servers** translate website URLs into IP addresses so users can reach the correct server.  
- On **October 21, 2016**, a major DNS service provider was hit by a large-scale DDoS attack.  
- Many large companies relied on this provider â†’ causing widespread outages across **North America and Europe**.

---

## Leading Up to the Attack
- A group of **university students** created a **botnet** to target gaming servers.  
- A **botnet** = a collection of malware-infected computers controlled by a **bot-herder**.  
- The students released the botnet code publicly â†’ allowing **other cybercriminals** to use it.  
- These criminals then used the botnet to attack the DNS service provider.

## The Day of the Attack
- **7:00 a.m.**: Botnet launched **tens of millions of DNS requests**, overwhelming the provider.  
- DNS services shut down â†’ users couldnâ€™t reach websites hosted by the provider.  
- After **2 hours**, systems were restored.  
- Further waves followed, but the DNS company was able to **mitigate the impact**.

## Key Takeaways
- DDoS attacks can disrupt **millions of users** and cause huge **financial/reputation losses**.  
- Critical services (like DNS) are **prime targets** since they affect many organizations at once.  
- **Botnets** make attacks more powerful and harder to stop.  
- Mitigation strategies include:
  - **Scalable, distributed hosting**  
  - **DDoS protection services**  
  - **Traffic filtering & monitoring**

ðŸ‘‰ Security analysts must be prepared to **detect and respond** quickly to limit the damage of DDoS attacks.
