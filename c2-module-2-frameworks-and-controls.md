# The Relationship Between Frameworks and Controls

---

## Overview
Frameworks and controls work together to help organizations mitigate risk, comply with regulations, and protect critical assets.  
- **Frameworks** = Guidelines for building security plans and achieving compliance.  
- **Controls** = Safeguards that reduce specific security risks and vulnerabilities.

## Frameworks

### **Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)**
- Developed by the U.S. government.
- Provides a **common language** for describing and communicating cyber threat activity.
- Helps analysts share and analyze threat intelligence efficiently.
- Improves response to evolving cyber threats.

### **ISO/IEC 27001**
- Internationally recognized framework for **information security management systems**.
- Supports all industries and sizes.
- Focuses on protecting assets such as financial info, intellectual property, and personal data.
- Does not require specific controls but offers a set of recommended controls.

## Controls
Controls are safeguards used alongside frameworks to **prevent, detect, or correct** security issues.  
They can be **physical, technical, or administrative**.

### **Physical Controls**
- Gates, fences, and locks  
- Security guards  
- CCTV and motion detectors  
- Access cards or badges  

### **Technical Controls**
- Firewalls  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- Antivirus software  

### **Administrative Controls**
- Separation of duties  
- Authorization policies  
- Asset classification

## Example: HIPAA Compliance
- Framework: HIPAA security rules  
- Control: MFA for patient portal logins to protect medical records.

## Key Takeaways
- Frameworks provide the **structure** for security programs.  
- Controls are the **actions/tools** that enforce security within those frameworks.  
- Both are essential to achieving strong security posture and regulatory compliance.  
- Organizations are strongly encouraged to adopt frameworks and implement robust controls, even when not legally required.
