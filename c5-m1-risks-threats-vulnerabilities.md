# Course 5 Module 1: Understand Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

## Overview
When security events occur, quick and coordinated communication is critical. To address problems effectively, security teams must understand and distinguish between **risks, threats, and vulnerabilities**.

## Key Terms
- **Risk**: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of an asset.  
- **Threat**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.  
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.  

> Note: In everyday language these terms may be used interchangeably, but in cybersecurity they have specific meanings.

## Security Risk
Organizations define risk differently depending on their assets and priorities. Risk is generally calculated as:

**Likelihood Ã— Impact = Risk**

### Example
- Driving to work involves the risk of being late.  
- Likelihood: Higher if you get a flat tire.  
- Impact: Could be serious, such as losing your job.  
- Businesses evaluate risks the same way, considering both likelihood and impact.

### Why We Calculate Risk
- Prevent costly and disruptive events  
- Identify improvements to systems and processes  
- Determine which risks can be tolerated  
- Prioritize critical assets requiring attention  

The business impact of a negative event depends on both the asset and the situation.  

## Personal Takeaways
- Risk assessment = probability + severity.  
- Helps explain why some risks are tolerated while others require urgent action.  
- As a security professional, focus is on protecting critical assets by understanding how threats exploit vulnerabilities and translate into risks.
