# Course 7 - Module 2 Notes

## Activity Overview
This module expanded on Python fundamentals by exploring functions, modules, and libraries.  
Since I already have prior experience with Python, much of this felt like review. The labs were straightforward and helped reinforce best practices.  

## What I Did
- Reviewed the difference between **user-defined functions** and **built-in functions**.  
- Practiced importing Python libraries and using them to solve tasks.  
- Revisited proper use of comments and style conventions with **PEP 8**.  

## Key Concepts
- **User-defined functions**: Functions I can create for specific tasks, allowing reusable and organized code.  
- **Built-in functions**: Predefined Python functions like `len()`, `print()`, or `range()` that simplify common operations.  
- **Importing modules and libraries**: Extends Python’s capabilities by adding powerful, specialized tools.  
- **Comments & PEP 8**: Writing clear, readable code is a best practice in both programming and cybersecurity scripts.  

## Personal Takeaways
This module reminded me how versatile Python becomes with external libraries. In past projects I’ve used:  
- **pandas** to manipulate and analyze data frames, which is directly relevant to analyzing large log files or security event data.  
- **BeautifulSoup** to scrape websites, a technique that overlaps with open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering in cybersecurity.  
- **TensorFlow** for machine learning experiments, which ties into security use cases like anomaly detection, phishing detection, and predictive threat analysis.  

Being able to build my own functions, combine them with built-ins, and then scale up with imports is exactly the kind of workflow security analysts rely on when automating investigations or handling large data sets. This module felt easy, but it’s a strong foundation for applying Python directly to cybersecurity tasks.
